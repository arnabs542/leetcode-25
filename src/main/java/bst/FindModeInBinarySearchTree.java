 * Given a binary search tree (BST) with duplicates, find all the mode(s) (the most frequently occurred element) in the
 * given BST.
 * Assume a BST is defined as follows:
 * The left subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys less than or equal to the node's key.
 * The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys greater than or equal to the node's key.
 * Both the left and right subtrees must also be binary search trees.
 * For example:
 * Given BST [1,null,2,2],
 * 1
 * \
 * 2

 * 2

Solution:
I've seen several solutions claimed to be O(1) space, but I disagree. They traverse the tree in in-order and keep track
of the current set of modes (among other things). But that's not O(1) space, not even when disregarding recursion stack
space (as explicitly allowed) and result space (not mentioned but reasonable). The set's contents aren't on stack space,
 so it can't be disregarded that way. And if the values are for example 1,2,3,4,...,n-2,n-1,n-1 (unique values followed
 by one double value), the set grows to Î©(n) and it can't be disregarded because the result only has size 1.

I think the way to do it properly is to do two passes. One to find the highest number of occurrences of any value, and
then a second pass to collect all values occurring that often. Any other ideas?

Here's a (two-pass) solution that I think can rightfully be called O(1) space. Both passes keep track of the current
value etc, and the second pass additionally collects the modes in the result array. I took the value handling out of the
 in-order traversal into its own function for clarity. Also, this way you could very easily replace my recursive
 in-order traversal with for example Morris traversal. Then you wouldn't even need to disregard the recursion stack
 space in order to claim O(1) extra space usage.
