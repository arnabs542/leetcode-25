This is a great thinking process.
Actually, I was also initially confused by the buy[i] and sell[i] definitions as many posted here.
Actually, I think it is clear to just look at the simplified equations without rest state (which does not impact profit anyway)
buy[i] = max(sell[i-2]-price, buy[i-1])
sell[i] = max(buy[i-1]+price, sell[i-1])
Now the definitions are clear.
buy[i] is the max profit up to day i with buy as last action;
sell[i] is the max profit up to day i with sell as last action.
Note that rest is not considered as an action, and the last action could happen in any day up to day i. Therefore, it is natural to say for buy[i], if the last buy didnâ€™t happen on day i, max profit is simply buy[i-1]; otherwise, a sell must happen at least 2 days ago (and no actions in between), so sell[i-2]-price.
And if we generalize the problem to have k cool down days:
buy[i] = max(sell[i-k-1]-price, buy[i-1])
sell[i] = max(buy[i-1]+price, sell[i-1])
