/**
 * We have a two dimensional matrix A where each value is 0 or 1.
 * <p>
 * A move consists of choosing any row or column, and toggling each value in that row or column: changing all 0s to 1s, and all 1s to 0s.
 * <p>
 * After making any number of moves, every row of this matrix is interpreted as a binary number, and the score of the matrix is the sum of these numbers.
 * <p>
 * Return the highest possible score.
 * <p>
 * <p>
 * <p>
 * Example 1:
 * <p>
 * Input: [[0,0,1,1],[1,0,1,0],[1,1,0,0]]
 * Output: 39
 * Explanation:
 * Toggled to [[1,1,1,1],[1,0,0,1],[1,1,1,1]].
 * 0b1111 + 0b1001 + 0b1111 = 15 + 9 + 15 = 39
 * <p>
 * <p>
 * Note:
 * <p>
 * 1 <= A.length <= 20
 * 1 <= A[0].length <= 20
 * A[i][j] is 0 or 1.
