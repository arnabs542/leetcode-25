/**
 * Given an array of characters, compress it in-place.
 * The length after compression must always be smaller than or equal to the original array.
 * Every element of the array should be a character (not int) of length 1.
 * After you are done modifying the input array in-place, return the new length of the array.
 * <p>
 * Example 1:
 * <p>
 * Input:
 * ["a","a","b","b","c","c","c"]
 * <p>
 * Output:
 * Return 6, and the first 6 characters of the input array should be: ["a","2","b","2","c","3"]
 * <p>
 * Explanation:
 * "aa" is replaced by "a2". "bb" is replaced by "b2". "ccc" is replaced by "c3".
